<!-- 1. VARIABLE -->
Variables are containers for storing variables and date values.
<!-- 2. values -->
A value is often stored in variables, e.g., let x be "value."
Values can be expressed in both words and numbers.

<<!-- 3. Data type -->
two categories of data types
primitive types and reference types
Data types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

<!-- 4. Initilization -->
when you assign a value to a variable
e.g., let color be "black."

<!-- 5. difference between let and var const -->
let = is used to declare variables that can later be reassigned to a new value.
const = to determine a value that cannot be reassigned after initialization
var: The variable declared with `var` is accessible throughout the entire function in which it is declared or globally if declared outside of any function.

<!-- 6. variable scoop -->

where variables can be accessed only when that specific function is called, it's only specific to that block of code.

<!-- 7. When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach, or do while loop? --> -->
for loop = used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a range of values. It allows precise control over the loop variable and the loop condition.

while loop: It is used when the loop should continue as long as a specific condition remains true.

do-while loop = it executes the loop block at least once before checking the loop condition.

forEach loop: It is used for iterating over elements of an array or any iterable object. It provides a concise way to perform an action on each element without the need to maintain an index.

<!-- 88. Define hoisting and variable scoping? --> 

8. Hoisting: where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, you can use variables before they are declared.

Variable scoping: where variables can be accessed only when that specific function is called, it's only specific to that block of code.
