<!-- 1. VARIABLE -->
<!-- Variables are containers for storing variables and date values. -->

<!-- 2. values -->
<!-- A value is often stored in variables, e.g., let x be "value."
Values can be expressed in both words and numbers. -->

<!-- 3. Data type -->
<!-- two categories of data types
primitive types and reference types
Data types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. -->

<!-- 4. Initilization -->
<!-- when you assign a value to a variable
e.g., let color be "black." -->

<!-- 5. difference between let and var const -->
<!-- let = is used to declare variables that can later be reassigned to a new value.
const = to determine a value that cannot be reassigned after initialization
var: The variable declared with `var` is accessible throughout the entire function in which it is declared or globally if declared outside of any function. -->

<!-- 6. variable scoop -->

<!-- where variables can be accessed only when that specific function is called, it's only specific to that block of code. -->

<!-- 7. When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach, or do while loop? --> 
<!-- for loop = used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a range of values. It allows precise control over the loop variable and the loop condition. -->

<!-- while loop: It is used when the loop should continue as long as a specific condition remains true. -->

<!-- do-while loop = it executes the loop block at least once before checking the loop condition. -->

<!-- forEach loop: It is used for iterating over elements of an array or any iterable object. It provides a concise way to perform an action on each element without the need to maintain an index. -->

<!-- 88. Define hoisting and variable scoping? --> 

<!-- Hoisting: where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, you can use variables before they are declared. -->

<!-- Variable scoping: where variables can be accessed only when that specific function is called, it's only specific to that block of code. -->
